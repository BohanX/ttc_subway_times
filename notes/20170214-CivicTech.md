# Civic Tech Hacknight 20170214
Lots of interest tonight!

Breakout groups:
 - Improve the scraper
 - Look at the data
 - Discuss performance metrics

Possible metrics:
 - excess wait time
   * [MBTA Back on Track](http://www.mbtabackontrack.com/performance/index.html#/explanations) has an explainer on wait time (I disagree with definition of excess wait time) 
 - tracking major incidents/disruptions
 - # short-turns and bypasses
